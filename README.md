# RAG and LLM

Curated papers, articles, and blogs on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in production**. üöÄ

Learn how organizations implement RAG with LLMs:

- **How** RAG is integrated with LLMs üîé
- **What** techniques and architectures worked ‚úÖ (and sometimes, what didn't ‚ùå)
- **Why** it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and references üìÇ
- **What** real-world results were achieved (so you can better assess ROI ‚è∞üí∞üìà)
